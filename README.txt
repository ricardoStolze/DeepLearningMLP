To run the python script open a terminal and run the following command:
- /path/to/python3 /path/to/mds_exercise3.py

Since this script takes much time to read the .csv files you can also run the folling command:
- /path/to/python3 /path/to/mds_exercise3_fast.py

This script uses downsampled data written into .npy files instead of the complete data. 
Everything wich happens after reading the .npy-files is the same as in the first code.
